Rocket Functions Package

Welcome to the Rocket Functions Package! This package contains a collection of functions that are useful for various tasks related to rocket design, simulation, and analysis. These functions are organized into submodules to make it easy to find and use the specific functionality you need.

Installation

To use the functions in this package, you can install it via pip. Open a terminal and run the following command:

pip install rocket-functions

This will install the Rocket Functions Package and make the functions accessible in your Python environment.

Usage

Once the package is installed, you can import the functions you need into your Python scripts or notebooks. Here's how you can import functions from the package:

from rocket_functions import submodule

# Example: Importing a specific function
from rocket_functions.submodule import my_function

# Now you can use the imported function in your code
result = my_function(argument1, argument2)

Replace 'submodule' with the name of the submodule containing the function you want to use, and 'my_function' with the name of the specific function you want to import.

Functionality

The Rocket Functions Package includes the following submodules:

- Structures: Functions related to structural analysis and design.
- Payload: Functions for payload analysis and integration.
- Modeling and Simulation: Functions for flight predictions and modeling
- Air Braks: Functions for air brakes analysis and integration.
- Avionics and Recovery: Functions for avionics and recovery analysis and integration.

Each submodule contains a set of functions tailored to specific aspects of rocket design and simulation. Refer to the documentation in each submodule for more details on the available functions and their usage.
